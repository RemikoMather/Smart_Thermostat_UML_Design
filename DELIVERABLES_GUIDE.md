# Smart Thermostat UML Design Package - Deliverables Guide

## Package Overview

This comprehensive UML design package contains all required deliverables for the Smart Thermostat System architecture project. The package is organized to provide both visual diagrams and detailed written documentation.

---

## üìÅ Package Contents

### 1. UML Diagrams (3 diagrams in PlantUML format)

Located in `/diagrams/` directory:

- **use_case_diagram.puml** - Illustrates system functionality from user perspective
- **sequence_diagram.puml** - Models object interactions for temperature setting scenario
- **deployment_diagram.puml** - Shows physical deployment of system components

### 2. Written Design Report

- **Design_Report.md** - Comprehensive report containing:
  - Introduction to the smart thermostat system and UML modeling
  - Definitions and importance of each diagram type
  - Detailed design justifications for all design decisions
  - APA-formatted references (30+ academic and industry sources)

### 3. Diagram Descriptions

- **diagrams/Diagram_Descriptions.md** - Detailed textual descriptions of all three diagrams for reference and understanding without rendering

## üîß How to View the UML Diagrams

### Option 1: Online PlantUML Renderer (Easiest)

1. Open https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
2. Copy the contents of any `.puml` file
3. Paste into the text editor on the website
4. The diagram will render automatically
5. Use "PNG" or "SVG" buttons to download rendered diagrams

### Option 2: VS Code with PlantUML Extension

1. Install the "PlantUML" extension in VS Code
2. Open any `.puml` file in this package
3. Press `Alt+D` (Windows/Linux) or `Option+D` (Mac) to preview
4. Or right-click ‚Üí "Preview Current Diagram"

**Required:** Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed

### Option 3: Command Line Rendering

If you have PlantUML installed locally:

```bash
java -jar plantuml.jar diagrams/use_case_diagram.puml
java -jar plantuml.jar diagrams/sequence_diagram.puml
java -jar plantuml.jar diagrams/deployment_diagram.puml
```

This will generate PNG images in the same directory.

### Option 4: Read Textual Descriptions

If you cannot render the diagrams, refer to:
- **diagrams/Diagram_Descriptions.md** for complete textual descriptions
